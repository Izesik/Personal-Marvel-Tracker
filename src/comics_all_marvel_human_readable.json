        "DESCRIPTION": "Experience the Eternals like never before in this super-sized edition! The limitless imagination of Jack \"King\" Kirby unleashed countless creations into the world of comics. Captain America. The Fantastic Four. The Avengers. The X-Men. Each timeless creation was imbued with Kirby's inescapable graphic power, his boundless capacity for capturing the human condition and his eternal search for meaning in the cosmos. And Kirby's The Eternals revealed an entire new realm of heroes! Once worshipped as gods, this fantastic group left Earth to explore the stars after warring with the Greek, Roman and Norse pantheons for supremacy over humankind. But the Eternals are just one part of a cosmic mythology. Their opposites - the Deviants - also secretly populate Earth. And the towering cosmic entities that created both - the Celestials - are fated to return and judge us all!",

She hung up her cape and tights when she realized she would forever be considered a second-rate super hero.

With Mattie in danger, Jessica Jones must seek help from an unlikely source \u2014 Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman \u2014 to bring her home alive. Then, for the first time, learn all of Jessica\u2019s hidden secrets \u2014 how she got her powers and joined the Avengers, and the dark, unspoken chapter in Marvel Universe history that changed her life forever.

At the height of her madness during the crisis known as M Day, the Scarlet Witch uttered those three little words that obliterated nearly the entire species of mutants, consigning them to the dustbin of Darwin's evolution.

Meanwhile, Magneto goes off on personal mission that sets him at odds with much of the X-Men...and the Marvel Universe. As Magneto reaches a crossroads, everything he's fought for is called into question...and he's forced to make a decision that will change him forever! Elsewhere, the ladies of the uncanny X-Men go out on the town - and find themselves face-to-face with the effects of Inhumanity!
